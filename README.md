# Maze Solver

## Overview

This project consists of several Python files that implement a maze generation and solving program using the Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI). The program creates a maze, animates its generation, and attempts to solve it using recursive backtracking.

## Files

### `graphics.py`

This file contains the implementation of a simple window abstraction using Tkinter. It provides a `Window` class that allows drawing lines on a canvas within the window.

### `cell.py`

Defines the `Cell` class, representing a cell in the maze. It includes methods for drawing cells, breaking walls, and animating cell movements.

### `maze.py`

Implements the `Maze` class, which is responsible for maze generation, solving, and animation. It utilizes the `Cell` class and includes recursive functions for breaking walls and solving the maze.

### `main.py`

The main file that initializes the window, creates a maze, attempts to solve it, and waits for the window to be closed.

## Learning Objectives

This project covers the following learning objectives:

1. **Tkinter GUI Programming:**
   - Understanding how to use Tkinter for creating graphical user interfaces.
   - Implementing a simple window and canvas for drawing.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Designing and implementing classes (`Window`, `Cell`, `Maze`) to encapsulate behavior and data.

3. **Recursion:**
   - Utilizing recursive algorithms for maze generation (recursive backtracking) and solving.

4. **Maze Generation and Solving:**
   - Understanding the logic behind maze generation using recursive backtracking.
   - Implementing a recursive algorithm for solving mazes.

5. **Animation:**
   - Implementing simple animations for maze generation and solving.
   - Using time delays to control the speed of animations.

6. **Readme Writing:**
   - Creating a README file to document the purpose, file structure, and learning objectives of the project.

## Instructions

1. Run `main.py` to generate and solve a maze. The result will be displayed in a Tkinter window.
2. Follow the printed messages in the console to understand the maze generation and solving process.
3. Close the Tkinter window when done exploring the maze.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of GUI programming, recursion, and algorithmic problem-solving.
